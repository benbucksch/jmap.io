# Participant Identities

A ParticipantIdentity stores information about a URI that represents the user within that account in an event's participants. It has the following properties:

- **id**: `Id` (immutable; server-set)
  The id of the ParticipantIdentity.
- **name**: `String` (default: "")
  The display name of the participant to use when adding this participant to an event, e.g. "Joe Bloggs".
- **sendTo**: `String[String]`
   Represents methods by which the participant may receive invitations and updates to an event.

     The keys in the property value are the available methods and MUST only contain ASCII alphanumeric characters (A-Za-z0-9). The value is a URI for the method specified in the key.


A participant in an event corresponds to a ParticipantIdentity if any of the method/uri pairs in the sendTo property of the participant are identical to a method/uri pair in the sendTo property of the identity.

The following JMAP methods are supported.

## ParticipantIdentity/get

This is a standard "/get" method as described in [@!RFC8620], Section 5.1. The *ids* argument may be `null` to fetch all at once.

## ParticipantIdentity/changes

This is a standard "/changes" method as described in [@!RFC8620], Section 5.2.

## ParticipantIdentity/set

This is a standard "/set" method as described in [@!RFC8620], Section 5.3. The server MAY restrict the uri values the user may claim, for example only allowing `mailto:` URIs with email addresses that belong to the user. A standard `forbidden` error is returned to reject non-permissible changes.

A participant identity may be destroyed that is referenced as the "defaultParticipantIdentityId" in the CalenderPreferences object for the same account. Doing so updates the defaultParticipantIdentityId property on the CalendarPreferences to `null`.
