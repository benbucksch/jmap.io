# Security considerations

All security considerations of JMAP ([@!RFC8620]) apply to this specification. Additional considerations specific to the data types and functionality introduced by this document are described in the following subsection.

## Privacy

Contacts consist almost entirely of private, personally identifiable information, and represent the social connections of users. Privacy leaks can have real world consequences, and contacts servers and clients MUST be mindful of the need to keep all data secure.

Servers MUST enforce the ACLs set on address books to ensure only authorised data is shared.
