# Introduction

JMAP ([@!RFC8620] JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic protocol for synchronising data, such as mail, calendars or contacts, between a client and a server. It is optimised for mobile and web environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to different data types.

This specification defines a data model for synchronising contacts between a client and a server using JMAP.

## Notational conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Type signatures, examples and property descriptions in this document follow the conventions established in Section 1.1 of [@!RFC8620].  Data types defined in the core specification are also used in this document.

## Terminology

The same terminology is used in this document as in the core JMAP specification, see [@!RFC8620], Section 1.6.

The terms AddressBook and ContactCard (with these specific capitalizations) are used to refer to the data types defined in this document and instances of those data types.

## Data Model Overview

An Account (see [@!RFC8620], Section 1.6.2) with support for the contacts data model contains zero or more AddressBook objects, which is a named collection of ContactCards. A ContactCard is a representation of a person, company, or other entity, or a group of such entities, in RFCXXXX JSContact Card format. Each ContactCard belongs to one or more AddressBooks.

In servers with support for JMAP Sharing [RFC XXX], data may be shared with other users. Sharing permissions are managed per AddressBook.

## Addition to the Capabilities Object

The capabilities object is returned as part of the JMAP Session object; see [@!RFC8620], Section 2. This document defines two additional capability URIs.

### urn:ietf:params:jmap:contacts

This represents support for the AddressBook and ContactCard data types and associated API methods. The value of this property in the JMAP Session capabilities property is an empty object.

The value of this property in an accountâ€™s accountCapabilities property is an object that MUST contain the following information on server capabilities and permissions for that account:

- **maxAddressBooksPerCard**: `UnsignedInt|null`
  The maximum number of AddressBooks (see Section XXX) that can be can assigned to a single ContactCard object (see Section XXX). This MUST be an integer >= 1, or null for no limit (or rather, the limit is always the number of AddressBooks in the account).
- **mayCreateAddressBook**: `Boolean`
  If true, the user may create an AddressBook in this account.
