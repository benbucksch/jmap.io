<abstract>
<t>This document specifies a data model for sharing data between users using JMAP. Future documents can reference this document when defining data types to support a consistent model of sharing.</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>JMAP (<xref target="RFC8620"></xref> JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic protocol for synchronizing data, such as mail, calendars or contacts, between a client and a server. It is optimized for mobile and web environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to different data types.</t>
<t>This specification defines a data model to represent entities in a collaborative environment, and a framework for sharing data between them that can be used to provide a consistent sharing model for different data types. It does not define <em>what</em> may be shared, or the granularity of permissions, as this will depend on the data in question.</t>

<section anchor="notational-conventions"><name>Notational Conventions</name>
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"></xref> <xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
<t>Type signatures, examples, and property descriptions in this document follow the conventions established in <xref target="RFC8620" section="1.1" sectionFormat="of"></xref>.  Data types defined in the core specification are also used in this document.</t>

<t>Examples of API exchanges only show the methodCalls array of the Request object or the methodResponses array of the Response object. For compactness, the rest of the Request/Response object is omitted.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>
<t>The same terminology is used in this document as in the core JMAP specification, see <xref target="RFC8620" section="1.6" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>.</t>
<t>The terms Principal, and ShareNotification (with these specific capitalizations) are used to refer to the data types defined in this document and instances of those data types.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="data-model-overview"><name>Data Model Overview</name>
<t>A Principal (see <xref target="principals"/>) represents an individual, team, or resource (e.g., a room or projector). The object contains information about the entity being represented, such as a name, description, and time zone. It may also hold domain-specific information. A Principal may be associated with zero or more Accounts (see <xref target="RFC8620" section="1.6.2" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>) containing data belonging to the Principal. Managing the set of Principals within a system is out of scope for this specification, as it is highly domain specific. It is likely to map directly from a directory service or other user management system.</t>
<t>Data types may allow users to share data with others by assigning permissions to Principals. When a user's permissions are changed, a ShareNotification object is created for them so a client can inform the user of the changes.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="subscriptions"><name>Subscriptions</name>
<t>Permissions determine whether a user <em>may</em> access data, but not whether they <em>want</em> to. Some shared data is of equal importance as the user's own, while other data is just there should the user wish to explicitly go find it. Clients will often want to differentiate the two. For example, a company may share mailing list archives for all departments with all employees, but a user may only generally be interested in the few they belong to. They would have <em>permission</em> to access many mailboxes, but can <em>subscribe</em> to just the ones they care about. The client would provide separate interfaces for reading mail in subscribed mailboxes and browsing all mailboxes they have permission to access in order to manage their subscriptions.</t>
<t>The JMAP Session object (see <xref target="RFC8620" section="2" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>) typically includes an object in the <tt>accounts</tt> property for every account that the user has access to. Collaborative systems may share data between a very large number of Principals, most of which the user does not care about day-to-day. The Session object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only include Accounts where either the user is subscribed to at least one record (see <xref target="RFC8620" section="1.6.3" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>) in the account, or the account belongs to the user. StateChange events for changes to data <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only be sent for data the user has subscribed to and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be sent for any account where the user is not subscribed to any records in the account, except where that account belongs to the user.</t>
<t>The server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> reject the user's attempt to subscribe to some resources even if they have permission to access them (e.g., a calendar representing a location).</t>
<t>A user can query the set of Principals they have access to with "Principal/query" (see <xref target="principal-query"/>). The Principal object will contain an Account object for all accounts where the user has permission to access data for that Principal, even if they are not yet subscribed.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="addition-to-the-capabilities-object"><name>Addition to the Capabilities Object</name>
<t>The capabilities object is returned as part of the JMAP Session object; see <xref target="RFC8620" section="2" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>. This document defines two additional capability URIs.</t>

<section anchor="urn-ietf-params-jmap-principals"><name>urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals</name>
<t>The <tt>urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals</tt> capability represents support for the Principal and ShareNotification data types and associated API methods.</t>
<t>The value of this property in the JMAP Session capabilities property is an empty object.</t>
<t>The value of this property in an account’s accountCapabilities property is an object that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the following information on server capabilities and permissions for that account:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>currentUserPrincipalId</strong>: <tt>Id|null</tt></t>
<t>The id of the Principal in this account that corresponds to the user fetching this object, if any.</t></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="urn-ietf-params-jmap-principals-owner"><name>urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals:owner</name>
<t>The URI <tt>urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals:owner</tt> is solely used as a key in an account’s accountCapabilities property. It does not appear in the JMAP Session capabilities — support is indicated by the <tt>urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals</tt> URI being present in the session capabilities.</t>
<t>If <tt>urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals:owner</tt> is a key in an account’s accountCapabilities, that account (and data therein) is owned by a Principal. Some accounts may not be owned by a Principal (e.g., the account that contains the data for the Principals themselves), in which case this property is omitted.</t>
<t>The value of this property is an object with the following properties:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>accountIdForPrincipal</strong>: <tt>Id</tt></t>
<t>The id of an account with the <tt>urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals</tt>
capability that contains the corresponding Principal object.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>principalId</strong>: <tt>Id</tt></t>
<t>The id of the Principal that owns this account.</t></li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="principals"><name>Principals</name>
<t>A Principal represents an individual, group, location (e.g., a room), resource (e.g., a projector) or other entity in a collaborative environment. Sharing in JMAP is generally configured by assigning rights to certain data within an account to other Principals. For example, a user may assign permission to read their calendar to a Principal representing another user or their team.</t>
<t>In a shared environment such as a workplace, a user may have access to a large number of Principals.</t>
<t>In most systems, the user will have access to a single Account containing Principal objects. In some situations, for example when aggregating data from different places, there may be multiple Accounts containing Principal objects.</t>
<t>A <strong>Principal</strong> object has the following properties:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>id</strong>: <tt>Id</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The id of the Principal.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>type</strong>: <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be one of the following values:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>individual</tt>: This represents a single person.</li>
<li><tt>group</tt>: This represents a group of other Principals.</li>
<li><tt>resource</tt>: This represents some resource, e.g., a projector.</li>
<li><tt>location</tt>: This represents a location.</li>
<li><tt>other</tt>: This represents some other undefined Principal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><t><strong>name</strong>: <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>The name of the Principal, e.g., "Jane Doe", or "Room 4B".</t></li>
<li><t><strong>description</strong>: <tt>String|null</tt></t>
<t>A longer description of the Principal, for example details about the facilities of a resource, or null if no description available.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>email</strong>: <tt>String|null</tt></t>
<t>An email address for the Principal, or null if no email is available. If given, the value MUST conform to the "addr-spec" syntax, as defined in <xref target="RFC5322" section="3.4.1" sectionFormat="comma" />.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>timeZone</strong>: <tt>String|null</tt></t>
<t>The time zone for this Principal, if known. If not null, the value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a time zone name from the IANA Time Zone Database <eref target="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">TZDB</eref>.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>capabilities</strong>: <tt>String[Object]</tt> (server-set)</t>
<t>A map of JMAP capability URIs to domain specific information about the Principal in relation to that capability, as defined in the document that registered the capability.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>accounts</strong>: <tt>Id[Account]|null</tt> (server-set)</t>
<t>A map of account id to Account object for each JMAP Account containing data
for this Principal that the user has access to, or null if none.</t></li>
</ul>

<section anchor="principal-get"><name>Principal/get</name>
<t>This is a standard "/get" method as described in <xref target="RFC8620" section="5.1" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="principal-changes"><name>Principal/changes</name>
<t>This is a standard "/changes" method as described in <xref target="RFC8620" section="5.2" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>. Note: implementations backed by an external directory may be unable to calculate changes. In this case, they will always return a "cannotCalculateChanges" error as described in the core JMAP specification.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="principal-set"><name>Principal/set</name>
<t>This is a standard "/set" method as described in <xref target="RFC8620" section="5.3" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>.</t>
<t>Managing Principals is likely tied to a directory service or some other vendor-specific solution. This management may occur out-of-band, or via an additional capability defined elsewhere. Allowing direct user modification of properties has security considerations, as noted in <xref target="security-considerations" />. Servers MUST reject any change it doesn’t allow with a <tt>forbidden</tt> SetError.</t>
<t>Where a server does support changes via this API, it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> allow an update to the "name", "description" and "timeZone" properties of the Principal with the same id as the "currentUserPrincipalId" in the Account capabilities. This allows the user to update their own details.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="principal-query"><name>Principal/query</name>
<t>This is a standard "/query" method as described in <xref target="RFC8620" section="5.5" sectionFormat="comma"></xref></t>

<section anchor="filtering"><name>Filtering</name>
<t>A <strong>FilterCondition</strong> object has the following properties, all of which are optional:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>accountIds</strong>: <tt>String[]</tt></t>
<t>A list of account ids. The Principal matches if any of the ids in this list are keys in the Principal's "accounts" property (i.e., if any of the account ids belong to the Principal).</t></li>
<li><t><strong>email</strong>: <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>The email property of the Principal contains the given string.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>name</strong>: <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>The name property of the Principal contains the given string.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>text</strong> <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>The name, email, or description property of the Principal contains the given string.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>type</strong>: <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>The type must be exactly as given to match the condition.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>timeZone</strong>: <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>The timeZone must be exactly as given to match the condition.</t></li>
</ul>
<t>All given conditions in the FilterCondition object must match for the Principal to match.</t>
<t>Text matches for "contains" SHOULD be simple substring matches.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="principal-querychanges"><name>Principal/queryChanges</name>
<t>This is a standard "/queryChanges" method as described in <xref target="RFC8620" section="5.6" sectionFormat="comma"></xref>. Note: implementations backed by an external directory may be unable to calculate changes. In this case, they will always return a "cannotCalculateChanges" error as described in the core JMAP specification.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="share-notifications"><name>Share Notifications</name>
<t>The ShareNotification data type records when the user's permissions to access a shared object changes. ShareNotification are only created by the server; users cannot create them explicitly. Notifications are stored in the same Account as the Principals.</t>
<t>Clients may present the list of notifications to the user and allow them to dismiss them. To dismiss a notification you use a standard "/set" call to destroy it.</t>
<t>The server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> create a ShareNotification whenever the user's permissions change on an object. It <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose not to create a notification for permission changes to a group Principal, even if the user is in the group, if this is more likely to be overwhelming than helpful, or would create excessive notifications within the system.</t>

<section anchor="auto-deletion-of-notifications"><name>Auto-deletion of Notifications</name>
<t>The server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> limit the maximum number of notifications it will store for a user. When the limit is reached, any new notification will cause the previously oldest notification to be automatically deleted.</t>
<t>The server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> coalesce notifications if appropriate, or remove notifications that it deems are no longer relevant or after a certain period of time.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="object-properties"><name>Object Properties</name>
<t>The <strong>ShareNotification</strong> object has the following properties:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>id</strong>: <tt>String</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The id of the ShareNotification.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>created</strong>: <tt>UTCDate</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The time this notification was created.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>changedBy</strong>: <tt>Entity</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>Who made the change.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>name</strong>: <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>The name of the entity who made the change.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>email</strong>: <tt>String|null</tt></t>
<t>The email of the entity who made the change, or null if no email is available.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>principalId</strong>: <tt>Id|null</tt></t>
<t>The id of the Principal corresponding to the entity who made the change, or null if no associated Principal.</t></li>
</ul></li>
<li><t><strong>objectType</strong>: <tt>String</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The name of the data type for the object whose permissions have changed, as registered in the <eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jmap/jmap.xhtml#jmap-data-types">IANA JMAP Data Types registry</eref>. e.g., "Calendar" or "Mailbox".</t></li>
<li><t><strong>objectAccountId</strong>: <tt>Id</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The id of the account where this object exists.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>objectId</strong>: <tt>Id</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The id of the object that this notification is about.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>oldRights</strong>: <tt>String[Boolean]|null</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The "myRights" property of the object for the user before the change.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>newRights</strong>: <tt>String[Boolean]|null</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The "myRights" property of the object for the user after the change.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>name</strong>: <tt>String</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The name of the object at the time the notification was made. Determining the name will depend on the data type in question. For example it might be the "title" property of a CalendarEvent or the "name" of a Mailbox. The name is to show to users who have had their access rights to the object removed, so that these users know what it is they can no longer access.</t></li>

<section anchor="framework-for-shared-data"><name>Framework for Shared Data</name>
<t>Shareable data types <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> define the following three properties:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>isSubscribed</strong>: <tt>Boolean</tt></t>
<t>> The value true indicates the user wishes to subscribe to see this data. The value false indicates the user does not wish to subscribe to see this data. The initial value for this property when data is shared by another user is implementation dependent, although data types may give advice on appropriate defaults.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>myRights</strong>: <tt>String[Boolean]</tt></t>
<t>The set of permissions the user currently has. Appropriate permissions are domain specific and must be defined per data type. Each key is the name of a permission defined for that data type. The value for the key is <tt>true</tt> if the user has the permission, or <tt>false</tt> if they do not.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>shareWith</strong>: <tt>Id[String[Boolean]]|null</tt></t>
<t>The value of this property is null if the data is not shared with anyone. Otherwise, it is a map where each key is the id of a Principal with which this data is shared, and the value associated with that key is the rights to give that Principal, in the same format as the <tt>myRights</tt> property. The account id for the Principal id can be found in the capabilities of the Account this object is in (see <xref target="urn-ietf-params-jmap-principals-owner"/>). </t>
<t>Users with appropriate permission may set this property to modify who the data is shared with. The Principal that owns the account this data is in <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be in the set of sharees since the owner's rights are implicit.</t></li>
</ul>

<section anchor="example"><name>Example</name>
<t>Suppose we are designing a data model for a very simple todo list. There is a Todo data type representing a single item to do, each of which belongs to a single TodoList. The specification makes the lists sharable by referencing this document and defining the common properties.</t>

<t>First it would define a set of domain-specific rights. For example, a TodoListRights object may have the following properties:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>mayRead</strong>: <tt>Boolean</tt></t>
<t>The user may fetch this TodoList, and any Todos that belong to this TodoList.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>mayWrite</strong>: <tt>Boolean</tt></t>
<t>The user may create, update, or destroy Todos that belong to this TodoList, and may change the "name" property of this TodoList.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>mayAdmin</strong>: <tt>Boolean</tt></t>
<t>The user may see and modify the "myRights" property of this TodoList, and may destroy this TodoList.</t></li>
</ul>

<t>Then in the TodoList data type, we would include the three common properties, in addition to any type-specific properties (like "name" in this case):</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>id</strong>: <tt>Id</tt> (immutable; server-set)</t>
<t>The id of the object.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>name</strong>: <tt>String</tt></t>
<t>A name for this list of todos.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>isSubscribed</strong>: <tt>Boolean</tt></t>
<t>True if the user has indicated they wish to see this list. If false, clients should not display this todo list with the user's other lists, but should provide a means for users to see and subscribe to all lists that have been shared with them.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>myRights</strong>: <tt>TodoListRights</tt></t>
<t>The set of permissions the user currently has for this todo list.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>shareWith</strong>: <tt>Id[TodoListRights]|null</tt></t>
<t>A map of Principal id to rights to give that Principal, or <tt>null</tt> if not shared with anyone or the user does not have the "mayAdmin" right for this list. Users with the "mayAdmin" right may set this property to modify who the data is shared with. The Principal that owns the account this data is in <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be in the set of sharees; their rights are implicit.</t></li>
</ul>

<t>We would define a new Principal capability with two properties:</t>
<ul spacing="compact">
<li><t><strong>accountId</strong>: <tt>Id|null</tt></t>
<t>The accountId containing the todo data for this Principal, if it has been shared with the requesting user.</t></li>
<li><t><strong>mayShareWith</strong>: <tt>Boolean</tt></t>
<t>May the user add this Principal as a sharee of a todo list?</t></li>
</ul>

<t>A client wishing to let the user configure sharing would look at the account capabilities for the Account containing the user's Todo data, and find the "urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals:owner" property, as per <xref target="urn-ietf-params-jmap-principals-owner"></xref>. For example, the JMAP Session object might contain:</t>

<figure><artwork>
{
  "accounts": {
    "u12345678": {
      "name": "jane.doe@example.com",
      "isPersonal": true,
      "isReadOnly": false,
      "accountCapabilities": {
        "urn:com.example:jmap:todo": {},
        "urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals:owner": {
          "accountIdForPrincipal": "u33084183",
          "principalId": "P105aga511jaa"
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
</artwork></figure>


<t>From this it now knows which account has the Principal data, and can fetch the list of Principals to offer the user to share the list with, making an API request like this:</t>

<figure><artwork>
[[ "Principal/get", {
  "accountId": "u33084183",
  "ids": null
}, "0" ]]
</artwork></figure>

<t>Here's an example response (where Joe Bloggs is another user that this user could share their todo list with, but who has not shared any data in their own account with this user):
</t>

<figure><artwork>
[[ "Principal/get", {
  "accountId": "u33084183",
  "state": "7b8eff5zz",
  "list": [{
    "id": "P2342fnddd20",
    "type": "individual",
    "name": "Joe Bloggs",
    "description": null,
    "email": "joe.bloggs@example.com",
    "timeZone": "Australia/Melbourne",
    "capabilities": {
        "urn:com.example:jmap:todo": {
            "accountId": null,
            "mayShareWith": true
        }
    },
    "accounts": null
  }, {
    "id": "P674pp24095qo49pr",
    "name": "Board room",
    "type": "location",
    ...
  }, ... ],
  "notFound": []
}, "0" ]]
</artwork></figure>

<t>A todo list can be shared with Joe Bloggs by updating its shareWith property, as in this example request:</t>

<section><name>Internationalisation Considerations</name>
<t>Experience has shown that unrestricted use of Unicode can lead to problems such as inconsistent rendering, users reading text and interpreting it differently than intended, and unexpected results when copying text from one location to another. Servers MAY choose to mitigate this by restricting the set of characters allowed in otherwise unconstrained <tt>String</tt> fields. The FreeformClass, as documented in <xref target="RFC7564" section="4.3" sectionFormat="comma" /> might be a good starting point for this.</t>
<t>Attempts to set a value containing code points outside of the permissible set can be handled in a few ways by the server. The first option is to simply strip the forbidden characters and store the resulting string. This is likely to be appropriate for control characters for example, where they can end up in data accidentally due to copy-and-paste issues, and are probably invisible to the end user. JMAP allows the server to transform data on create/update, as long as any changed properties are returned to the client in the <tt>/set</tt> response, so it knows what has changed, as per <xref target="RFC8620" section="5.3" sectionFormat="comma" />. Alternatively, the server MAY just reject the create/update with an <tt>invalidProperties</tt> SetError.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>All security considerations of JMAP <xref target="RFC8620"></xref> apply to this specification. Additional considerations are detailed below.</t>

<section anchor="spoofing"><name>Spoofing</name>
<t>Allowing users to edit their own Principal's name (and, to a lesser extent, email, description, or type) could allow a user to change their Principal to look like another user in the system, potentially tricking others into sharing private data with them. Servers may choose to forbid this, and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> keep logs of such changes to provide an audit trail.</t>
<t>Note that simply forbidding the use of a name already in the system is insufficient protection, as a malicious user could still change their name to something easily confused with the existing name by using trivial misspellings or visually similar Unicode characters.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="unnoticed-sharing"><name>Unnoticed Sharing</name>
<t>Sharing data with another user allows someone to turn a transitory account compromise (e.g., brief access to an unlocked or logged-in client) into a persistent compromise (by setting up sharing with a user that is controlled by the attacker). This can be mitigated by requiring further authorisation for configuring sharing, or sending notifications to the sharer via another channel whenever a new sharee is added.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="unauthorised-principals"><name>Unauthorised Principals</name>
<t>The set of Principals within a shared environment <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be strictly controlled. If adding a new Principal is open to the public, risks include:</t>
<ul spacing="compact">
<li>An increased risk of a user accidentally sharing data with an unintended person.</li>
<li>An attacker may share unwanted or offensive information with the user.</li>
<li>An attacker may share items with spam content in the names in order to generate ShareNotification objects, which are likely to be prominently displayed to the sharee.</li>
</ul>
